                    I often work long hours at the shop with a great deal of tight deadlines.
                    It's really important for me that nothing goes wrong with paint clogging or behaving unexpectedly!
                    Colorisious stocks the very best brands of paint and equipment and have never failed to deliver!

                    I do paint a lot! There is no way I'm paying premium for equipment that I can have at a bargain that still does the job!
                    Colorisious has a good range of cheap stuff that I can use for my painting without worrying that I'll break it or how much color I use.
                    I just wanna chill with my minis, no hastle!

                    I mostly do two or even three jobs a day. I really do not have time to go pick up paint.
                    With Colorisious I can get it delivered to the sites where I work without even having to bother.
                    Simply add the work schedule and paint id's ahead of time and they'll sort it out! Invaluable!
