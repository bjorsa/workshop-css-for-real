# 25. Responsive design

The viewport meta tag is actually set in all of the HTML files.

## The task

Open the browser in mobile view and have a look at the web page, starting with the main page.

Wrap the current font size for the #heading-section h1 in a new media query that activates the current style once the device viewport is at least
40 rem and place it below the current styles for the element.

Reduce the font-size of the same element in the default style to better fit the mobile view.

Fix the retailer layout so that the retailers are displayed below one another.

In the navigation bar, fix the page links so that the Products, Our Customers and Contact Us links are displayed below the
main page link in mobile view. This is not the final solution, but will do for now.

Reduce the #header-section h1 element and place it near the bottom edge of the background image, to better fit it in landscape mode on your mobile.

The footer also covers some our site, add some margin to the main in shared.css to give it some space.

Make sure that the favourite products are displayed 2 on each line directly under each other in mobile view.

Also restyle the customer testimonials to make it look good in mobile.
