# 15. Browser Compatibility

Web development is targeting a lot of different browsers, not all of which are up to date on current standards with regards to CSS (and other development tools).

At MDN, each CSS property are documented with current browser support.

Also, for some additional inspections of the state of web technologies, there is a site called Can I use, targeting not only CSS but HTML and javascript as well. In addition to letting you know what browser supports something, market shares statistics are displayed as well.

## The task

Go to the page for the display property: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display

Click on the display-inside link under the Syntax section and then scroll down to have a look at what kind of browser support are
offered to the different layout options.

Now, go to _Can I use_ and search for _grid_:
https://caniuse.com/#search=grid

Compare what you see in the results to what was listed at MDN. Look at the market share figures and read the information.

Can I use also lists related properties, have a look at the other properties that was returned by your search and examine the results.

There is no solution for this exercise, I just wanted you to be aware of where to find good documentation for what is supported and what is not.
