# CSS for real

If you're like me and are using CSS on a daily basis, yet find yourself constantly searching for answers on the internet and stack overflow to fix or implement what seems like basic layout issues, this set of exersizes are for you. 
You might also find this material useful if you're in the process of learning web development and CSS or if you are brushing up on that skillset and find yourself wanting to explore in more detail some of the features of CSS and web layout that you come across.

## Setting up your development environment

It is beyond the scope of this workshop to go into the configuration of individual tools for developing and maintaining CSS and web applications in general. That being said, to follow along in the workshop material, you are going to need some things.

### Editor of choice

Any IDE where you are comfortable working will do, I will however recommend a couple of options.

* __Visual Studio Code__ - A good, free and cross platform option for working with web development and scripting.
* __Atom__ - Free, potent editor with a huge number of capabilities available as plugins.

### Browsers

I would recommend that you at least install Chrome, but preferrably other browsers as well so that you can better examine the results of your CSS code. The examples illustrated as part of this workshop will mostly be using chrome since that is the browser that I find to have the most useful debugging tools when it comes to CSS and web development in general.

## Exersizes

In this repository and associated material I present a set of exersizes that you can explore to further your understanding of some CSS3 topic. The exersizes are organized by topic ranging from beginner level through intermediary and all the way to some of the more advanced topics dealing with more recent additions to CSS and web layout.

You are free to explore the exersizes in whatever order you see fit. 
They all build upon each other and include the result from the previous making it possible to go through them one by one, starting at some point where you feel you would benefit the most, or selecting any of them and focusing on some particular topic.
As an example web page I have used a fictive business web page of a paint supply vendor, Colorisious Inc., that you might contact when you need to do a new paint job on your house.

### How to use an exersize

In the table below I have listed all the exersizes. The first one with a very basic HTML page tasking you to introduce your very first CSS into the page. Ranging through a wide variety of topics the following exersizes lets you examine diferent aspects of CSS.

Each of the exercises is contained in its own folder containing a README.md detailing the goals of the exersize along with a description of the included files. Links to any relevant resources and a pointer to the appopriate place in the workshop slides can also be found here.

| Start tag | End tag | Description | Topic keywords |
|-|-|-|-|
| inline-css__start | inline-css__end | Inlining CSS | basics, inclusion |

## Resources

In addition, I have gathered a set of useful resources that I'm including in this README that might be of use when you need to look something up or otherwise have some web design need that you need to adress. This includes generators for font size, color schemes and more.

I have tried to highlight resources again as they become relevant for some particular exersize.
